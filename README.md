# hello-world
My first repository

Hello World! I am starting a new job next week at Kubrick Group and I am testing out github beforehand to get to know what's what.
Today the new Call of Duty: Cold War zombies map, "Firebase Z", came out. I played and worked out how to make the new wonder weapon, the Rai K-84.
